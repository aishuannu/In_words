This program prints any given number between 0 and 100,000,000  in words.

I have defined three functions. First function returns the index at which '0' occurs first in a given string. Second function takes a three digit number as input and return it in words. Third function takes numbers as input and repeatedly use second function to return it in words.

I am planning to work on readablity and maintainability of this code as suggested by one of my friends.
